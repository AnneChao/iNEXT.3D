Description: iNEXT.3D is a sequel to iNEXT. Here the three dimensions (3D) of diversity includes taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD). A unified framework based on Hill numbers (for TD) and their generalizations (Hill-Chao numbers, for PD and FD) is adopted to quantify 3D. In this framework, TD quantifies the effective number of species, PD quantifies the effective total branch length, mean-PD (PD divided by tree depth) quantifies the effective number of lineages, and FD quantifies the effective number of virtual functional groups (or functional "species"). Thus, TD, mean-PD, and FD are all in the same units of species/lineage equivalents and can be meaningfully compared.
