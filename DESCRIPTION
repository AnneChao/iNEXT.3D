Description: As a sequel to 'iNEXT', the 'iNEXT. 3D' package provides functions to compute standardized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity (3D) estimates with a common sample size or sample coverage. Hill numbers and their generalizations are used to quantify 3D. The package also features size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves to facilitate rigorous comparison of 3D diversity across individual assemblages.
